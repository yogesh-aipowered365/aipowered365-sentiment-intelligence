## ⚖️ Public vs Private - FAQ

**Q: Won't people steal my idea if it's public?**
A: No, because:
- Your value is in the service (API/premium), not the code
- Anyone can see how restaurants work but still pays for food
- Open-source actually builds credibility

**Q: Is my code safe to share?**
A: Yes! Your code contains no secrets or proprietary logic - just a UI wrapper around a public model.

**Q: Can someone copy my exact app?**
A: Yes, but they'd still need to:
- Host it somewhere (costs money)
- Support users
- Handle scaling
- While you get paid for the professional service
